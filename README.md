# Basic Electronics
Before dealing with the comprehensive programming with a 
microcontroller, it is very important to learn the 
basic electronics first.

## Electrical & Electronics Engineering
> Electrical and electronics engineering, the branch of 
engineering concerned with the practical applications of 
electricity in all its forms, including those of the field
of electronics. Electronics engineering is that branch of 
electrical engineering concerned with the uses of the 
electromagnetic spectrum and with the application of such 
electronic devices as integrated circuits and transistors.
>
> In engineering practice, the distinction between electrical 
engineering and electronics is usually based on the comparative 
strength of the electric currents used. In this sense, electrical 
engineering is the branch dealing with “heavy current”—that is, 
electric light and power systems and apparatuses—whereas 
electronics engineering deals with such “light current” applications
as telephone and radio communication, computers, radar, 
and automatic control systems.

## Electronics and Robotics
Electronics devices can simply be controlled by adding a 
microcontroller. When we program an electronic device the
way we want it to work (particularly with sensors),
it can be considered a robot.
