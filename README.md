# Introduction To Electronics 

## Electrical & Electronics Engineering
> Electrical and electronics engineering, the branch of 
engineering concerned with the practical applications of 
electricity in all its forms, including those of the field
of electronics. Electronics engineering is that branch of 
electrical engineering concerned with the uses of the 
electromagnetic spectrum and with the application of such 
electronic devices as integrated circuits and transistors.
>
> In engineering practice, the distinction between electrical 
engineering and electronics is usually based on the comparative 
strength of the electric currents used. In this sense, electrical 
engineering is the branch dealing with “heavy current”—that is, 
electric light and power systems and apparatuses—whereas 
electronics engineering deals with such “light current” applications
as telephone and radio communication, computers, radar, 
and automatic control systems.

## Electronics and Robotics
Electronic devices can simply be controlled by adding a 
**microcontroller**. When we program an electronic device
to do specific tasks (particularly with sensors),
we are now dealing with robotics. 

## The Microcontroller
> A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed 
to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. A typical
microcontroller includes a processor, memory and input/output 
(I/O) peripherals on a single chip.
> 
> Sometimes referred to as an embedded controller or microcontroller 
unit (MCU), microcontrollers are found in vehicles, robots, office 
machines, medical devices, mobile radio transceivers, vending machines 
and home appliances, among other devices. They are essentially simple 
miniature personal computers (PCs) designed to control small features of 
a larger component, without a complex front-end operating system (OS).

### Arduino UNO (microcontroller)

## Circuit
> In electronics, a circuit is a closed path that allows 
electricity to flow from one point to another. It may include various
electrical components, such as transistors, resistors, 
and capacitors, but the flow is unimpeded by a gap or 
break in the circuit.

### Two Basic Types of Circuits

Series Circuit
> a series circuit comprises a path along which the 
whole current flows through each component. 

Parallel Circuit
> a parallel circuit comprises branches so that the 
current divides and only part of it flows through any branch.

## Tech Terms
`voltage` - an electromotive force or potential difference 
expressed in volts.

`open circuit` - an electrical circuit that is not complete.

`electric current` -  the rate at which electric 
charge flows past a point on the electric circuit. 

`ampere` - the SI base unit of electrical current.

`ground` - In electronics and electrical engineering, it is 
by convention, we define a point in a circuit as a reference
point. This reference point is known as ground (or GND) and
carries a voltage of 0V. Voltage measurements are relative 
measurements. That is, a voltage measurement must be compared
to another point in the circuit. If it is not, 
the measurement is meaningless.

`hot wire` (electrical term) - carries the electricity, also called `live wire`

## Voltage Vs Amperage
Voltage and amperage are two measures of electrical 
current or flow of electrons. Voltage is a measure of 
the pressure that 
allows electrons to flow, while amperage is a measure
of the volume of electrons.

## Electronic Components Used in Our Project
1. Power Supply -
It is the one responsible to power electrical
components.
We'll be using a Direct Current source,
a battery.

2. Wires

3. Light-Emitting Diode - a diode that emits
light. A `diode` is a semiconductor device with 
two terminals, typically allowing the flow of current 
in one direction only. A `semiconductor` is a substance,
usually a solid chemical element or compound, that can 
conduct electricity under some conditions but not others, 
making it a good medium for the control of electrical
current.

4. Switch - the component that can disrupt
the flow of a circuit, thereby giving us control.
